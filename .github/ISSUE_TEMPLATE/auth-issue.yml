        To capture trace logs, set the environment variables `GCM_TRACE=1` and `GIT_TRACE=1` and re-run your Git command.
        If you are running inside of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you must also set an additional environment variable to enable tracing: `WSLENV=$WSLENV:GCM_TRACE`. For example:

        ```shell
        WSLENV=$WSLENV:GCM_TRACE:GIT_TRACE GCM_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 git fetch
        ```

        If you are using GCM version 2.0.567 onwards you can also run `git credential-manager diagnose` to collect useful diagnostic information that can be attached here.

        :warning: **Please review and redact any private information before attaching logs and files!**
