### Standalone installation

You can also download the [latest installer][latest-release] for Windows to
install GCM standalone.

**:warning: Important :warning:**

Installing GCM as a standalone package on Windows will forcibly override the
version of GCM that is bundled with Git for Windows, **even if the version
bundled with Git for Windows is a later version**.

There are two flavors of standalone installation on Windows:

- User (`gcmuser-win*`):

  Does not require administrator rights. Will install only for the current user
  and updates only the current user's Git configuration.

- System (`gcm-win*`):

  Requires administrator rights. Will install for all users on the system and
  update the system-wide Git configuration.

To install, double-click the desired installation package and follow the
instructions presented.

### Uninstall (Windows 10)

To uninstall, open the Settings app and navigate to the Apps section. Select
"Git Credential Manager" and click "Uninstall".

### Uninstall (Windows 7-8.1)

To uninstall, open Control Panel and navigate to the Programs and Features
screen. Select "Git Credential Manager" and click "Remove".

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Git Credential Manager can be used with the [Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL)][ms-wsl] to enable secure authentication of your remote Git
repositories from inside of WSL.

[Please see the GCM on WSL docs][gcm-wsl] for more information.

git-credential-manager configure
