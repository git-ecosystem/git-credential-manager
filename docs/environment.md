# Environment variables

[Git Credential Manager Core](usage.md) work out of the box for most users. Configuration options are available to customize or tweak behavior.

Git Credential Manager Core (GCM Core) can be configured using environment variables. **Environment variables take precedence over [configuration](configuration.md) options.**

For the complete list of environment variables GCM Core understands, see the list below.

## Available settings

### GCM_TRACE

Enables trace logging of all activities.
Configuring Git and GCM to trace to the same location is often desirable, and GCM is compatible and cooperative with `GIT_TRACE`.

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GIT_TRACE=%UserProfile%\git.log
SET GCM_TRACE=%UserProfile%\git.log
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GIT_TRACE=$HOME/git.log
export GCM_TRACE=$HOME/git.log
```

If the value of `GCM_TRACE` is a full path to a file in an existing directory, logs are appended to the file.

If the value of `GCM_TRACE` is `true` or `1`, logs are written to standard error.

Defaults to tracing disabled.

_No configuration equivalent._

---

### GCM_TRACE_SECRETS

Enables tracing of secret and sensitive information, which is by default masked in trace output.
Requires that `GCM_TRACE` is also enabled.

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_TRACE=%UserProfile%\gcm.log
SET GCM_TRACE_SECRETS=1
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_TRACE=$HOME/gcm.log
export GCM_TRACE_SECRETS=1
```

If the value of `GCM_TRACE_SECRETS` is `true` or `1`, trace logs will include secret information.

Defaults to disabled.

_No configuration equivalent._

---

### GCM_TRACE_MSAUTH

Enables inclusion of Microsoft Authentication libraries (ADAL, MSAL) logs in GCM trace output.
Requires that `GCM_TRACE` is also enabled.

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_TRACE=%UserProfile%\gcm.log
SET GCM_TRACE_MSAUTH=1
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_TRACE=$HOME/gcm.log
export GCM_TRACE_MSAUTH=1
```

If the value of `GCM_TRACE_MSAUTH` is `true` or `1`, trace logs will include verbose ADAL/MSAL logs.

Defaults to disabled.

_No configuration equivalent._

---

### GCM_DEBUG

Pauses execution of GCM Core at launch to wait for a debugger to be attached.

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_DEBUG=1
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_DEBUG=1
```

Defaults to disabled.

_No configuration equivalent._

---

### GCM_INTERACTIVE

Permit or disable GCM Core from interacting with the user (showing GUI or TTY prompts). If interaction is required but has been disabled, an error is returned.

This can be helpful when using GCM Core in headless and unattended environments, such as build servers, where it would be preferable to fail than to hang indefinitely waiting for a non-existent user.

To disable interactivity set this to `false` or `0`.

#### Compatibility

In previous versions of GCM this setting had a different behavior and accepted other values.
The following table summarizes the change in behavior and the mapping of older values such as `never`:

Value(s)|Old meaning|New meaning
-|-|-
`auto`|Prompt if required – use cached credentials if possible|_(unchanged)_
`never`,<br/>`false`| Never prompt – fail if interaction is required|_(unchanged)_
`always`,<br/>`force`,<br/>`true`|Always prompt – don't use cached credentials|Prompt if required (same as the old `auto` value)

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_INTERACTIVE=0
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_INTERACTIVE=0
```

Defaults to enabled.

**Also see: [credential.interactive](configuration.md#credentialinteractive)**

---

### GCM_PROVIDER

Define the host provider to use when authenticating.

ID|Provider
-|-
`auto` _(default)_|_\[automatic\]_
`azure-repos`|Azure Repos
`github`|GitHub
`generic`|Generic (any other provider not listed above)

Automatic provider selection is based on the remote URL.

This setting is typically used with a scoped URL to map a particular set of remote URLs to providers, for example to mark a host as a GitHub Enterprise instance.

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_PROVIDER=github
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_PROVIDER=github
```

**Also see: [credential.provider](configuration.md#credentialprovider)**

---

### GCM_AUTHORITY _(deprecated)_

> This setting is deprecated and should be replaced by `GCM_PROVIDER` with the corresponding provider ID value.
>
> Click [here](https://aka.ms/gcmcore-authority) for more information.

Select the host provider to use when authenticating by which authority is supported by the providers.

Authority|Provider(s)
-|-
`auto` _(default)_|_\[automatic\]_
`msa`, `microsoft`, `microsoftaccount`,<br/>`aad`, `azure`, `azuredirectory`,</br>`live`, `liveconnect`, `liveid`|Azure Repos<br/>_(supports Microsoft Authentication)_
`github`|GitHub<br/>_(supports GitHub Authentication)_
`basic`, `integrated`, `windows`, `kerberos`, `ntlm`,<br/>`tfs`, `sso`|Generic<br/>_(supports Basic and Windows Integrated Authentication)_

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_AUTHORITY=github
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_AUTHORITY=github
```

**Also see: [credential.authority](configuration.md#credentialauthority-deprecated)**

---

### GCM_ALLOW_WINDOWSAUTH

Allow detection of Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) support for generic host providers. Setting this value to `false` will prevent the use of WIA and force a basic authentication prompt when using the Generic host provider.

**Note:** WIA is only supported on Windows.

**Note:** WIA is an umbrella term for NTLM and Kerberos (and Negotiate).

Value|WIA detection
-|-
`true`, `1`, `yes`, `on` _(default)_|Permitted
`false`, `0`, `no`, `off`|Not permitted

#### Example

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_ALLOW_WINDOWSAUTH=0
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_ALLOW_WINDOWSAUTH=0
```

**Also see: [credential.allowWindowsAuth](environment.md#credentialallowWindowsAuth)**

---

### GCM_HTTP_PROXY _(deprecated)_

> This setting is deprecated and should be replaced by the [standard `http.proxy` Git configuration option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-httpproxy).
>
> Click [here](https://aka.ms/gcmcore-httpproxy) for more information.

Configure GCM Core to use the a proxy for network operations.

**Note:** Git itself does _not_ respect this setting; this affects GCM _only_.

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_HTTP_PROXY=http://john.doe:password@proxy.contoso.com
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_HTTP_PROXY=http://john.doe:password@proxy.contoso.com
```

**Also see: [credential.httpProxy](configuration.md#credentialhttpProxy-deprecated)**

---

### GCM_GITHUB_AUTHMODES

Override the available authentication modes presented during GitHub authentication.
If this option is not set, then the available authentication modes will be automatically detected.

**Note:** This setting supports multiple values separated by commas.

Value|Authentication Mode
-|-
_(unset)_|Automatically detect modes
`oauth`|OAuth-based authentication
`basic`|Basic/PAT-based authentication

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_GITHUB_AUTHMODES="oauth,basic"
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_GITHUB_AUTHMODES="oauth,basic"
```

**Also see: [credential.gitHubAuthModes](configuration.md#credentialgitHubAuthModes)**

---

### GCM_NAMESPACE

Use a custom namespace prefix for credentials read and written in the OS credential store.
Credentials will be stored in the format `{namespace}:{service}`.

Defaults to the value `git`.

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_NAMESPACE="my-namespace"
```

##### macOS/Linux

```bash
export GCM_NAMESPACE="my-namespace"
```

**Also see: [credential.namespace](configuration.md#credentialnamespace)**

---

### GCM_CREDENTIAL_STORE

Select the type of credential store to use on supported platforms.

Default value is unset.

**Note:** This setting is only supported on Linux platforms. Setting this value on Windows and macOS has no effect.  See more information about configuring secret stores on Linux [here](linuxcredstores.md).

Value|Credential Store
-|-
_(unset)_|(error)
`secretservice`|[freedesktop.org Secret Service API](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/) via [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) (requires a graphical interface to unlock secret collections).
`gpg`|Use GPG to store encrypted files that are compatible with the [`pass` utility](https://www.passwordstore.org/) (requires GPG and `pass` to initialize the store).
`credentialcache`|Git's built-in [credential cache](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-cache).
`plaintext`|Store credentials in plaintext files (**UNSECURE**). Customize the plaintext store location with [`GCM_PLAINTEXT_STORE_PATH`](#GCM_PLAINTEXT_STORE_PATH).

##### Linux

```bash
export GCM_CREDENTIAL_STORE="gpg"
```

**Also see: [credential.credentialStore](configuration.md#credentialcredentialstore)**

---

### GCM_CREDENTIAL_CACHE_OPTIONS

Pass [options](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-cache#_options)
to the Git credential cache when [`GCM_CREDENTIAL_STORE`](#GCM_CREDENTIAL_STORE)
is set to `credentialcache`. This allows you to select a different amount
of time to cache credentials (the default is 900 seconds) by passing
`"--timeout <seconds>"`. Use of other options like `--socket` is untested
and unsupported, but there's no reason it shouldn't work.

Defaults to empty.

#### Linux

```shell
export GCM_CREDENTIAL_CACHE_OPTIONS="--timeout 300"
```

**Also see: [credential.credentialCacheOptions](configuration.md#credentialcredentialcacheoptions)**

---

### GCM_PLAINTEXT_STORE_PATH

Specify a custom directory to store plaintext credential files in when [`GCM_CREDENTIAL_STORE`](#GCM_CREDENTIAL_STORE) is set to `plaintext`.

Defaults to the value `~/.gcm/store`.

#### Linux

```shell
export GCM_PLAINTEXT_STORE_PATH=/mnt/external-drive/credentials
```

**Also see: [credential.plaintextStorePath](configuration.md#credentialplaintextstorepath)**

---

### GCM_MSAUTH_FLOW

Specify which authentication flow should be used when performing Microsoft authentication and an interactive flow is required.

Defaults to the value `auto`.

Value|Authentication Flow
-|-
`auto` _(default)_|Select the best option depending on the current environment and platform.
`embedded`|Show a window with embedded web view control.
`system`|Open the user's default web browser.
`devicecode`|Show a device code.

##### Windows

```batch
SET GCM_MSAUTH_FLOW="devicecode"
```

##### macOS/Linux
